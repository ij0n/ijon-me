I love sailing. It keeps me sane. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ea89cd05-2a33-4280-ba55-52512eab50aa.JPG)

Together with my business partner, I founded the Hackerfleet. We are developing opensource maritime software systems. We are implementing a Bring-your-own-device system for ships, so Crews can truly cooperate on navigation and shiphandling through modern webbased systems, hosted on board.
