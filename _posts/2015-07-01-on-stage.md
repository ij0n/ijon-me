I am an experienced stage manager and moderator. I love to give talks and large audiences dont scare me.  If there is such a thing, then my superpower would be that I can make people feel enthusiastic.  I gathered experience on various conferences, for example LinuxTag Berlin, re:publica15 and several Chaos Communication Conferences and Camps
