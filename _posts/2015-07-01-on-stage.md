I am an experienced stage manager and moderator. I love to give talks and large audiences dont scare me. 

If there is such a thing, then my superpower would be that I can make people feel enthusiastic.  ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d6fb1027-bbff-4f45-8205-6bec980271e2.jpg)
